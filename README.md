# Heart Disease Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The model is trained on the **Heart Disease Prediction Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **TensorFlow** & **Keras**: For building and training the ANN model.
- **scikit-learn**: For preprocessing and evaluating model performance.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

## Accuracy

- The model achieved an **accuracy of 83.52%** on the dataset.
